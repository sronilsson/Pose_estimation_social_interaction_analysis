##### Video example of data output on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/Q2ByLfwJIaw)

##### Tutorial

1. Place tracking files from DLC in **tracking_data** folder

2. Place video files in **videos**  folder

3. If visualizing the data, place the frames in the **input_frames** folder, within a subfolder with the same name as the video (without file ending). 

4. Run the py files in the order 1,2,3,4,5:
    
    * 1_Rename_files.py standardize all the tracking file names
    * 2_correct_devs_mov.py corrects large tracking innacuracies by removing large 'jumps' in relation to the animal size
    * 3_Specify_coordinates.py lets the user define the bounding boxes of the regions of interest (ROI) in each video using [OpenCV](https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_tutorials.html)
    * 4_Analyze_data.py analyzes the time spent in each (ROI). The fps of the videos is defined on Line 16
